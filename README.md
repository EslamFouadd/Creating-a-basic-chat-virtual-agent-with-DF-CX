# Creating-a-basic-chat-virtual-agent-with-DF-CX
In this lab, you'll explore the fundamentals of developing a chat virtual agent in Dialogflow CX. By the end of this lab, you will be able to build a subset of the conversational agent functionality needed for a fictional Cloud Audio online business using Dialogflow CX-specific design considerations.

In this project I've created, deployed, secured, debugged, and managed virtual agents (also known as Voice Bots or Chat Bots). Gone are the bots of the past which interpreted inquiries incorrectly or couldn't maintain context within a conversation. Google's Contact Center Artificial Intelligence (Contact Center AI) platform provides all the tools, services, and APIs you'll need to build your virtual agent so you can hold intelligent conversations with customers reaching out to you for assistance.
